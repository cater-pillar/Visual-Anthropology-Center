Autoethnography as a method in anthropological research\r\n        </h4>\r\n        <h5>Nina Mladenović & Relja Pekić\r\n        </h5>\r\n        <p>In this lecture we will present the basic principles of autoethnographic writing in anthropology, as a method which implies the intersection of personal, lived experiences of a researcher with socio-political context that shaped and enabled these experiences. Throughout the lecture we will speak about the advantages of using autoethnography as a method but also encourage critical thinking and consider possible problems researchers might encounter while using this method. Some of the questions we will try to answer are: What is authoethnography and when shuould we use it as a method? How do we differentiate autoethnography from self-analysis? What are the techniques of authoethnographic writing? What are ethical dilemmas within authoethnographic research and how to overcome them?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h4>2. Queer Autoethnography\r\n        </h4>\r\n        <h5>Vanessa Zallot\r\n        </h5>\r\n        <p>In this input session we draw upon ideas of queer methodology and ask the question how these ideas can be helpful in our ways of thinking about (audio-/visual) autoethnography. By the idea of queer as a critique of multiple power structures that are written into our daily lives and the academia, the question is opened up, what power structures and normativities we might reproduce in our research practice. How could these be reflected methodologically? And how might it be a starting point for generating and acknowledging new kinds of knowledge apart from those normatively deemed ‚normal‘ and ‚scientific‘?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h4>3. Sonic Autoethnography \r\n        </h4>\r\n        <h5>Nikola Radeka\r\n        </h5>\r\n        <p>Aim of this lecture is to inspire and encourage its participants to engage in a research of sonic self - to actively listen, pre-select, record, select and organize sounds that they produce and that they are surrounded with on a daily basis.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Participants will be guided through both the theory and practice of Sonic/Aural Autoethnography by video lectures and mentoring sessions, which will cover the following:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Introduction to Autoethnography and placing Sonic Autoethnography within the heterogeneous field of Autoethnography;\r\n        Repositioning sonic perspective: comprehension of oneself\'s relation to the quotidian soundworld, broadening aural perspectives by a range of selected listening practices, discovering specific aspects of auditory self;\r\n        Sonic scenography: developing situational awareness from environmental sound events;\r\n        Telling a story: recognizing, developing and layering narratives through sound;\r\n        Learning classical and traditional music composing techniques and music forms to be implemented in the creation process;\r\n        Unleashing the intrinsic sonic potential through self-experiments.\r\n        Sonic Autoethnographies may reflect in many possible outcomes depending on the methodology of content preselection, different sound creation and recording techniques, as well as the final sound organization / composing and postproduction, even combining the sound with other media. Participants will be encouraged to express themselves in one or more of the following formats combined: Self-sufficient/self-explanatory field recordings; Sonic or music diaries; Aural postcards; Sonic scenography;  Sonic poetry; Self-composed songs or music pieces; Multichannel soundscape compositions; Headphone pieces; Public sound installations; Aural interventions in space; Voice experiments (different narrative types); Format free releases.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h4>4. Autoethnography – the Self and the Senses\r\n        </h4>\r\n        <h5>Thomas John\r\n        </h5>\r\n        <p>In this class we look especially at audio-visual autoethnographies that exploit and experiment sensory cinema methods. Interestingly, quite a number of autoethnographic films have been attempting to mediate meanings about the Self through the senses. Investigating sensory experience is not easy, because it is highly embodied and driven by affects. The moment we speak and interview about it, it is yet not the same thing anymore. We also cannot observe it easily, since sensory experience is highly subjective and interior. However, if you do an autoethnography, you might be able to have very immediate access to sensory experience, obviously, since it is your very own! Still, it remains a challenge to represent your own senses.

I will suggest tools like: discrete and loud actions, drawings in non comfortable conditions, video diary of certain kind, science-like collection, stop-motion techniques as therapy...all that with a reason to deal differently with your flat, mess in your room, neighbors,...someone you secretly fantasied about.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Some of those “games”, I tried in my previous works, so I am offering one possible method but it is more like a starting point.

Possible paradigmatic shifts in performing arts\r\n        </h4>\r\n        <h5>Ana Popović\r\n        </h5>\r\n        <p>Keywords: crisis, body, media, theatricality, perceptive turn\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Usually when we mention anthropological approach to performing arts, we think of rituals, rites of passages, transferring and transformative patterns of human behavior and roles of any kind. The most interesting part of the ritual, understood in the terms of Turner, is the so-called liminal state. It is a state in which we need to shift our perception from ‘what it used to be’ to ‘what it will become’. It is deeply political situation as well as aesthetical. Performing arts, unlike others, are essentially and exclusively humanistic oriented. They adapt to human behavior, the same way human needs to adapt to new circumstance. That is also a very specific ability of the spe(c)tator in the performance – redefining relations of all kinds, while interpretation and reinterpretation (of self, of others, of objects, of spacetime) are essentially creative processes. Right now, the most of our reality is mediated through technology. This tells a lot about human behavior and vice versa. Our bodies are under new regulations, and also the way we (are expected to) behave. We cannot group, gather, perform live, be close to each other. Internet shows that it is not able to mediate performance arts. But, internet, which also makes most of our reality, is full of theatricality and we perceive it in a specific liminal way.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>It didn’t seem that this digital revolution would feel so corporeal.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Literature references: Antonin Artaud, Richard Schechner, Victor Turner, Stephen Greenblatt, Bruno Latour, Erika Fischer-Lichte, Timothy Morton, Donna Haraway, Karen Barad and many more\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h4>9.

We will argue whether our artwork is speaking to others about spirit of time in which it was created, and could people who will watch final products of our workshop understand what we were going trough in this  time of pandemic.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>The second part of this lecture is reserved for talk about self-observation, a practice of observing yourself as if another person, or even a camera or video recorder, might see you. You will be introduced to some practical exercises which will help you in observing your thoughts, emotions, feelings, moods, sensations, movements, sound, facial expressions, and so on without any judgment, in order to help you in better creation of your auto-ethnography project.\r\n        </p>'),

As such, they offer complex and often contradictory layers of meaning.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Sound recording allows for the temporal dislocation of a sound from its time and place of origin, but does not facilitate the ability to do the auditory equivalent of sustaining the gaze on an image for as long or as short as one desires (...) This way of thinking about the temporality of sound has often led to an essentialization of sound as ephemeral, or at least elusive. (Helmreich 2010)\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>That is why we always think of sound and image not just as complementary tools, image giving the sound a necessary context (or a lack of such) and vice versa, but as two manifestations of the same phenomena. By combining pictures and sounds we can create new harmonies or dissonances that can make discover unexpected cracks in our social reality. These two “remote” senses respond to waves and allow us to experience things which are not in our immediate surroundings – the famed “Other”. Of these two, image gives us the necessary distance, and sound the necessary immersion. Isn’t it strange that so often when we are talking about “the voice of the other” we actually mean showing the image of the Other? \r\n</p>\r\n                <p>In embracing an understanding of audiovisual anthropology that does not stop at voiceover, but extends to all the patterns of a complex environment made up of speech, music, sounds, noise, and silence, this subject opens up many possible debates on how we can configure our film narrative, parallely examining both the aural and visual world around us. New digital technologies have now expanded the acoustic environment globally, thus also offering unprecedented opportunities to the “ethnographic ear.” (Marazzi, 2019)\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Sound is both the object and (partially the  method) of our audio-visual research in 2020. The sound of human voice, the sound of music, the sound of home – the notion of “sound” is neutral, if not positive. It always asks for more explanation about the nature of the sound and the listener. Sounds are culturally conditioned and ethnographers have the task to categorize a variety of sound milieus and attach meaning to them. The sound recording can be heard as if it were music or at least an organized sound from which we could decode various affective or subliminal reactions.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Silence, as solitude, is something we yearn for in an urban landscape. And yet, in political and social activism, silence is a synonym for passivity. Silence in social everyday life is conditioned by cultural patterns that impose rules of conduct in different places. Silence can also be understood as a liminal phase in which an individual or collective awaits the reaction of the \"other\".\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>On the other hand, \"noise\" is presented as the enemy of \"sound\" and an exhaustive shuffling of the diverse sounds that need to be parsed. It is a social construct elicited by various social practices that can be interpreted as sound miles or a collage of sounds that are most commonly latently configured. Soundscape research seeks to draw public awareness of the acoustic environment and to improve our work in the experience of listening. With the help of advances in audio technology, field recording and archiving, environmental sounds become important for the social interpretation of our everyday lives. \r\n</p>\r\n                <p>We at Visual Anthropology Center are interested in discovering and investigating what is the variety of meanings and interrelations they can have in the urban environment of today’s Belgrade but also exploring their ambivalences and paradoxes in the more general context.\r\n</p>'),
